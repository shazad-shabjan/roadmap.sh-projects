# Project Solutions For Roadmap.sh

Hi 👋 I'm Shazad and this repository contains the solutions for the [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) projects. I recently started learning front-end development using the [front-end roadmap by roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/frontend). And so this repository contains the solutions for each project. I've just started working and I'll make sure to update the repository as I complete each project.

### View each project README and live demo:

01 - [Single-Page CV](front-end-projects/01-single-page-cv)  
02 - [Basic HTML Website](front-end-projects/02-basic-html-website)  
03 - [Personal Portfolio](front-end-projects/03-personal-portfolio)  
04 - [Changelog Component](front-end-projects/04-changelog-component)
